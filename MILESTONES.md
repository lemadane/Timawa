## Phase Breakdowns

### Phase 0: Specification Baseline

- **Dependencies**: Phase 2.
- **Risks**: Platform-specific C-ABI calling conventions and linker flag differences.
- **Estimate**: 5 Engineer-Weeks.
- **Exit Criteria**: **MVP Milestone**: A valid Talas "Hello World" application (`class Application { void main() { ... } }`) compiles to a native executable and runs with exit code 0.
- **Parallelization**: LLVM IR generator and `talas-runtime` library can be built in parallel.

### Phase 4: Complete Class Model
- **Deliverables**: `var` field mutation validation, immutable-field protection, primary constructor argument lowering, class memory layout generation, package-private member access checks, and instance method dispatch.
- **Dependencies**: Phase 3.

### Phase 5: Anonymous Objects
- **Deliverables**: Literal object parser, structural type inference, canonical field ordering algorithm, generated getter methods, structural `equals` and `hash` generation, and `with` expression updates.
- **Dependencies**: Phase 4.
- **Risks**: Name mangling collisions for structurally identical anonymous object types across modules.
- **Estimate**: 4 Engineer-Weeks.

- **Parallelization**: Structural type checking and `with` LLVM lowering can proceed in parallel.

---

### Phase 6: Control Flow
- **Deliverables**: Collection-based `for` loop lowering, indexed iteration, condition loops, infinite loops, `break` and `continue`, `switch` statements and expressions with `case` arrows, `if` guards, `yield`, and exhaustiveness validation.
- **Dependencies**: Phase 4.
- **Risks**: Complex control flow graph basic block splitting in nested switch expressions.
- **Estimate**: 5 Engineer-Weeks.
